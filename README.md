## How to use this project

This is a Ruby project.
You will need to tell your favourite Ruby version manager to set your local Ruby version to the one specified in the `.ruby-version` file.

For example, if you are using [rbenv](https://cbednarski.com/articles/installing-ruby/):

1. Install the right Ruby version:
```bash
$ rbenv install < VERSION >
$ rbenv rehash
```
1. Move to the root directory of this project and type:
```bash
$ rbenv local < VERSION >
$ ruby -v
```

You will also need to install the `bundler` gem, which will allow you to install the rest of the dependencies listed in the `Gemfile` file of this project.

```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ rbenv rehash
```


### Folder structure

* `bin `: Executables
* `lib `: Sources
* `spec`: Tests


### To initialise the project

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake
```


### To run the tests

```bash
$ bundle exec rspec --color
```


### To run the app

Make sure that the `bin/app` file has execution permissions:

```bash
$ chmod +x bin/app
```

Then just type:

```bash
$ bin/app
```
